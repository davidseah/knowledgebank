# How to learn Maths

How to stay up to date with maths as a working programmer. 

There are a few foundational tasks that I think engineers involved with computation/numerical work need to just "know" on any given day of the year, so if these techniques are a bit rusty, I would start here. These techniques are

1. Taking a derivative of any polynomial and all common transcendental functions
2. Compute a Taylor series expansion of some function \( possibly with a tool\) and understanding what it means
3. Converting a system of equations to a matrix representation and vice versa
4. Inverting and finding the eigenvalues of said matrix

Knowing the above gives you a decent base in analysis\( Calculus\) and linear algebra so that even if you forget details of some theorem or algorithm, you won't be off by more than a few wikipedia reads. 

This isn't just about memorization! If you've built sufficient intuition in those topics, you'll be able to derive or retrace your steps at any point. It's important that you understand not just the theory but situations in which they're useful.
