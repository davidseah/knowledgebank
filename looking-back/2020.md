# 2020

## January

This year Chinese New Year started early. It was a bad start to the year due to the Covid 19 virus breakout. 

## February

A leap year which means that there is 29 days in February this year. The year is getting challenging due to changes at work and I don't expect to get any easier. At least for the whole year. This will be a challenging year. I have bough a new running shoes and started to run more frequently. But the speed is still slow and I can feel my body getting weaker. Hope to stay consistent in my running regime throughout this year. My church services has also stopped meeting physically so now meeting is online which I am still finding hard to get used to.
