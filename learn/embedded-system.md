UTAustinX: UT.6.10xEmbedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output

## Description

An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical and chemical components along with a computer hidden inside to perform a single dedicated purpose. 

The course has been split into two. Part 1 is 8 labs in chapters 1-10 and part 2 is 7 labs in chapters 11-16. The introduction lab occurs in both parts. 

## Approach

The approach taken in this course is to learn by doing in a bottom-up fashion. One of the advantages of a bottom-up approach to learning is that the student begins by mastering simple concepts.
