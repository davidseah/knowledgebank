# Class

**Fundamental Idea of a class**  
Data abstraction and encapsulation

**Data abstraction**  
Separate of interface and implementation

**Encapsulation**  
Enforces the separation of a class' interface and implementation. A class that is encapsulated hides its implementation - users of the class can use the interface but will have no access to the implementation.
