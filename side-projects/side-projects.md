# Side Projects

Side Projects are a way to learn and keep my skill as a programmer, problem solver and builder. In technology there are many things that is going on, machine learning, cryptography, mobile application development, desktop application, games, and many more.

In short, it is impossible to know everything. But it is possible to know some things. The trick is to know what you really want to build. What problems are the most important in your life. Based on the problem and interest, start working on a project and learn the necessary skills. 

For me current interest will be

* Computer Graphics Engine
* Web development
