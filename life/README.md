## Abstract Goals

1. Able to write in a way that stirs emotions and communicate my thoughts clearly  
2. A healthy body, that looks good \(no tummy\), physically fit, with no addiction
3. Good problem solver 
4. Plays the guitar well
5. Master learning

Always ask why. Why do I want these goals?

### Able to write in a way that stirs emotions and communicate my thoughts clearly  

After working as a software engineer for 5 years, I learned that building a good software is not just programming. It is more than programming, you need to be able to communicate your ideas, to convince and to persuade. 

## Habits

1. At least 7 hours of sleep every day
2. Sleep and wake up the same time
