# Productivity Manifesto

For everything in life, I believe that there is a secret. A way of doing it differently from the rest of the crowd that allows you to win in life. It might sound like it is difficult to do, which causes people not to do it. But many times it is not difficult but a lack of understanding of how the world or humans works. I do not know everything but I want to experiment and uncover the secrets of live. 

Many people hates rules. But rules are a guideline of the laws of life. You cannot overcome nature just because you do not like it. The most efficient way to live life is to align yourself to the laws of the nature and flow with it. Do not fight it. In order to flow with the laws of the nature, there are rules that I need to follow. I will attempt to list them out over here. 

I am currently reading mark manson blog. So many of the topics will be from his blog.

## Attention Deficient

In this age, we are living in a world of attention deficient. Just look around, and see how many people are addicted to their screen. I believe that simply by being aware of the power of scree addiction, and try not to be addicted yourself, you are in the top 20%. 

## 80/20 Rule



## Do Something Principle



loop 

**Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Etc.**

Taking advantage of this knowledge we can reorient our mind. 

 **Action → Inspiration → Motivation** 

 ****If I am lacking any motivation to make an important changes in life, just do something, do anything to harness the reaction of the action as a form of motivation.

## Better to do something that you can sustain for a long period of time

## Habits

1. At least 7 hours of sleep every day
2. Sleep and wake up the same time
3. Exercise 3 times a week

## Rules to follow

Simple rules to follow but make huge impact

1. Eat as little sugar as possible
2. Intermittent fasting
3. Plan the day/month/year ahead using a list

## Leave a person/place/code/environment better when I step out than when I enter in

## Instead of asking what can I get, ask what can I give or how can I help you.  

## Spend time to truly understanding something

Knowing something in a deep way brings satisfaction. To understand something deep also means you can explain simply to another person which brings up your joy as a engineer. 

## Keep Calm and focus on the current task 

When we are trying to solve a problem, it will be better to just keep calm and just focus on the current question. Learn to focus and not panic when in a scenario like a coding interview. Practice to think calmly in such situation.
