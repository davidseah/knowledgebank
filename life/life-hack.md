# Life Hack

## Overview

What do I want in life? Why do I want it? How do I get it? I think these are important questions that I need to ask myself regularly. To have a clear map of getting from point A to B. By asking why, I keep myself motivated to stay on the path. Also it has to be something that I really want and not just appears to be nice. I am not going to plan for long term. I don't see a point as many things are going to be changed. Of course, I will still be prudent. I will not sacrifice short term benefits at the expense of suffering later. 

## Money 

I am earning a decent amount of money as a software engineer. I am not crazy rich and cannot send on unnecessary luxury goods or go for holiday every other month. But I can pretty much do whatever I want. So I am not going to focus too much on my time on earning money. I will still be prudent and try to spend as little as possible. Only buying something when I really want or need it. I want to clear my student loan and mortgage as soon as possible. I also want to have an amount of money saved so that I can start looking into investing. 

## Sleep

Sleep is very important to my well being. I will prioritize sleep other any other things. The goal is to have at least 7 hours of sleep everyday and to sleep at the same time everyday. Which is from 1130 pm to 645 am.

## Exercise

Have a healthy body makes me feel good about myself. Also to be able to move easily is important. I will want to exercise at least 3-4 times a week. Either some form of cardio or strength training. It will be nice if I can loose my fats around my waist.

## Diet

I will like to go for ketogenic diet but it is kinda hard for me to follow. The other ways is to eat less sugar and to go for intermittent fasting. I don't eat breakfast and I should try to reduce snacking and eating any desert or drinking any sweet drinks.
