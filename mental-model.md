### Contribute to the open source community

When you contribute to the open source community, it will empower you, Tejada said. "When you contribute to a project, pay attention to the feedback you get from users and other developers," he added. "When you give to the community, make sure you take advantage of the opportunity to receive as well."

Recognize how important it is to interact with your professional community, but also think long and hard about what you want your role to be, said Charlie Robbins, director of engineering at GoDaddy and former member of the board of the Node.js Foundation. "Rather than chasing the notoriety of a 'superstar' developer, make sure you're speaking at conferences, writing blog posts, and engaging in mentorship projects that you actually feel passionate about," Robbins said. "Exchanging ideas and learning new things from your community can help avoid burnout, but only if you're approaching it in a genuine way."

### Code the real world, and code frequently

"There is no replacement for coding solutions to real world problems and the practice that comes from these experiences," said Willie Tejada, chief developer advocate at IBM. "What you code isn't as important as coding as frequently as possible and challenging yourself."

This requires putting in the hours to improve your programming skills, said Avi Flombaum, co-founder and dean of the Flatiron School. "Don't just learn how to use something—know how it works," Flombaum said. "Spend more time learning how and why things are built as opposed to just how to use them. Always try to go one layer deeper into the most important concepts."

You can use GitHub to publicly display passing projects or exercises, and have other developers in your network review your code and provide commentary on where it can improve or how you can approach things differently, said Paul Wallenberg, unit manager of technology recruiting services at LaSalle Network.

"Programmers that are on the hunt for a new job must showcase the projects they have worked on," said Manu Singh, a mobile developer at Clearbridge Mobile. "This sets you aside from the competition and shows not only what projects you've worked on, but a deeper look at who you are, how you completed the work, and where you want to go. By putting together a portfolio of your work, you're building your personal brand."

### Work on a side project

A side project may sound daunting, but you should consider starting one just for fun, Mazzina said. "Programming something you're passionate about is crucial to development, and by taking on a side project with no expectations other than to have fun and learn, you'll be surprised at how much you can grow," Mazzina said. "Try learning a new programming language, or build an app to sharpen your skills and broaden your ability."

GitHub is also full of projects both large and small that welcome contributions, said Cynan de Leon, head of data engineering and analytics for Mint at Intuit. "This is a great place to see if someone has already started creating your idea, and see what ways it can be improved," de Leon said. "You also get the benefit of having other people look at what you've contributed, continuing that cycle. It could be something as small as a Sudoku solver, or something as huge as a top-level Apache project. It doesn't matter; if you're passionate about it, go for it."

### Develop a specialty

Programming changes very quickly—often, you learn one technology, and by the next week, it's been replaced with something better, said Alex Markov, developer and founder of Refersion. "My advice is to specialize by focusing on a smaller segment of tech, such as database admin, front-end web development, etc.—then keep up with that industry, learn everything, be the best. That's how you'll win at your career," Markov said. "Employers will respect you more when you say, 'I don't know about the other stuff, but when it comes to XYZ, I got your back all the time.'"

If you're struggling to choose a language to begin with, you should pick one and learn it well, Vassallo said. "While we all need to pick up various languages on the path to becoming a programming guru, it pays to really try and shine in one field," Vassallo said. "It's totally fine to be a jack of all trades, in fact, it's welcomed. A master of none has a less than desirable skill set."

### Your success is determine by the seeds you planted than by the harvest you get

### Give a shit about what you work on

### Don't give a shit what others think

### Invest at Least 10 Percent of Your Income in Yourself

If you don't pay for something, you rarely pay attention.

Most people want stuff that's free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously.

How much do you invest in yourself?

How committed are you to yourself?

If you aren't investing in yourself, than you don't have any skin in the game of your own life.

If you aren't invested in your business, you probably won't do high-quality work.

If you're not invested in your relationships, you're probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give.

When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10 percent of your income in yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you'll get at least 100 dollars back in returns.

If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you'll ever do well will be the result of high-quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it's because you haven't received quality mentoring in that thing.

The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you'll take the relationship far more seriously. You won't solely be taking in that relationship. You won't purely be a consumer. Instead, you'll be invested, and as such, you'll listen more carefully. You'll care more. You'll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding.

I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe four or five hours of his time. But in those four or five hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi-six-figure book contract.

Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I'm confident that to this day I'd still not have written a book proposal. At the very most I'd have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action.

If you don't have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It's a matter of priority.

It's only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen.

Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs, such as online courses and books, and quality products to help you eat and sleep better.

Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you're not getting the results you want, it's because you haven't invested enough to get those results.

Your No. 1 investment must be yourself.

Who you are determines:

the quality of marriage you'll have the quality of parent you'll become the quality of work you'll produce the level of happiness you'll have.

### Invest at Least 80 Percent of Your "Off" Time Into Learning

Most people are consumers rather than creators.

They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference.

When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time.

Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can't have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off.

Entertainment is all well and good--but only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You'll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships.

Still, life isn't purely about being entertained. Education is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future.

The world's most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do.

If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high-value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out.

### Don't Work for Money, Work to Learn

"When you are young, work to learn, not to earn." -- Robert Kiyosaki

Just as a large majority of your downtime should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your "working" time.

Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money.

Only 20 percent of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting.

It is by "sharpening your saw" that you'll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time to becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you'll be able to charge very, very high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you.

When you prioritize learning and recovery, then you'll be in a deep flow state during the hours you are actually working. You won't be distracted, like most people are when they work. You're either 100 percent on or 100 percent off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days.

Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you're well-rested, and your mind is stimulated.

### Don't Learn for Entertainment, Learn to Create More Value

"The key secret to success is not excessive expertise, but the ability to use it. Knowledge is worthless unless it is applied." -- Max Lukominskyi

In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don't put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information.

Information and knowledge are two very different things.

Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things.

It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it.

Unless you're invested, you probably won't learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge.

Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won't have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return.

When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they've read lots of books. If you're not applying what you're learning, your consuming and wasting your time.

### Be Lazy, But Not Intellectually Lazy

A while ago, Jeff Atwood wrote about the merits of laziness for successful software developers. 

Lest this become the mantra of sub-performing developers everywhere, I wanted to follow up with a clarification. It’s fine to be lazy as he described in the article, just don’t be intellectually lazy. 

What do I mean by this? First and foremost, when you are writing code, make sure you really understand what the code is doing. 

The classic illustration of mental laziness is encountering an off-by-one error. When encountering the error, the lazy developer would simply append a “ 1” to the end of the statement, re-run the code, and if it seemed to work, move on. Or they might change a “&lt; x” to “&lt;= x” For simple cases, this may be the correct solution, but the problem arises when the developer doesn’t take the time to evaluate why the error was made in the first place. Sometimes, the simple fix only works for a narrow range of inputs and masks a larger error. 

This solution is merely one example of a whole class of anti-solutions I call “Try It and See” solutions. The developer simply moves code around a bit and crosses his fingers to see if it works. Off-by-one errors are only the tip of the iceberg. 

This class of anti-solutions often come up when when a developer is using a framework such as ASP.NET in which he is unfamiliar. On a recent project, I noticed one of the developers had put nearly all of the page logic within the PreRender override. I asked the developer why he put it there, since the proper place would have been in OnLoad. 

He replied that OnLoad was too early to run that code because the controls didn’t have their settings from the inline control declaration within the aspx file. Hmm, I’m pretty sure they would be there by then I told him, and he said in his experience, they are not. So I emailed him the order of events within the ASP.NET page lifecycle and pointed out that the method AddParsedSubObject happens after the constructor and way before OnLoad is called. 

I believe that he did encounter a weird problem a long time ago with control declarations not filtering through, but rather than dig into the problem and really understand what was going on, he simply moved the code to PreRender, saw that it worked now, and cleared his hands of the problem. I can understand that on a rush project, there’s a temptation to simply try things till they work and then move on, but you will save more time in the long run if you take a break and dig into the problem to get a real clear understanding of what is happening. 

Likewise, spend time getting up to speed on the framework you are using. For example, ASP.NET has a usable form validation framework. Learn it. Use it. There’s no point in wasting time writing your own framework for validation unless you know the ASP.NET validation framework inside and out and really need to work around its limitations. 

And if you are going to write your own, consider buying a package first such as Peter Blum’s validation package. So once again, be lazy, but not mentally lazy. Write unit tests up front where they make sense. Learn the framework you are using. Understand the code you are writing or debugging. And in the long run, you’ll be making your life \(and your coworkers lives\) easier. Perhaps that’s the true laziness.
