# Philosophy

### Contribute to the open source community

When you contribute to the open source community, it will empower you, Tejada said. "When you contribute to a project, pay attention to the feedback you get from users and other developers," he added. "When you give to the community, make sure you take advantage of the opportunity to receive as well."

Recognize how important it is to interact with your professional community, but also think long and hard about what you want your role to be, said Charlie Robbins, director of engineering at GoDaddy and former member of the board of the Node.js Foundation. "Rather than chasing the notoriety of a 'superstar' developer, make sure you're speaking at conferences, writing blog posts, and engaging in mentorship projects that you actually feel passionate about," Robbins said. "Exchanging ideas and learning new things from your community can help avoid burnout, but only if you're approaching it in a genuine way."

### Code the real world, and code frequently

"There is no replacement for coding solutions to real world problems and the practice that comes from these experiences," said Willie Tejada, chief developer advocate at IBM. "What you code isn't as important as coding as frequently as possible and challenging yourself."

This requires putting in the hours to improve your programming skills, said Avi Flombaum, co-founder and dean of the Flatiron School. "Don't just learn how to use somethingâ€”know how it works," Flombaum said. "Spend more time learning how and why things are built as opposed to just how to use them. Always try to go one layer deeper into the most important concepts."

You can use GitHub to publicly display passing projects or exercises, and have other developers in your network review your code and provide commentary on where it can improve or how you can approach things differently, said Paul Wallenberg, unit manager of technology recruiting services at LaSalle Network.

"Programmers that are on the hunt for a new job must showcase the projects they have worked on," said Manu Singh, a mobile developer at Clearbridge Mobile. "This sets you aside from the competition and shows not only what projects you've worked on, but a deeper look at who you are, how you completed the work, and where you want to go. By putting together a portfolio of your work, you're building your personal brand."

### Work on a side project

A side project may sound daunting, but you should consider starting one just for fun, Mazzina said. "Programming something you're passionate about is crucial to development, and by taking on a side project with no expectations other than to have fun and learn, you'll be surprised at how much you can grow," Mazzina said. "Try learning a new programming language, or build an app to sharpen your skills and broaden your ability."

GitHub is also full of projects both large and small that welcome contributions, said Cynan de Leon, head of data engineering and analytics for Mint at Intuit. "This is a great place to see if someone has already started creating your idea, and see what ways it can be improved," de Leon said. "You also get the benefit of having other people look at what you've contributed, continuing that cycle. It could be something as small as a Sudoku solver, or something as huge as a top-level Apache project. It doesn't matter; if you're passionate about it, go for it."
